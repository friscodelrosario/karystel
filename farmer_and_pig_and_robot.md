## Farmer and Pigs and Robot

When Karel the Robot was introduced as an educational programming language 40-some years ago, it was effective partly because the Karel language is so limited in its function.

These days, we might call Karel a "domain-specific language", designed for writing programs to solve a specific kind of problem. (My earliest programming jobs involved the domain language Selenium, which was like Karel in that its instructions could be written in many different programming languages, but the instructions were limited to controlling web browsers, like Karel instructions are limited to controlling Karel the robot.)

Karel is a beginner-friendly language for being specific to a domain, and for the very small size of the domain. Selenium was specific to interacting with web browsers, but web browsers interact with the web, an infinitely-sized space. Karel the robot operates in a world that's typically laid out as a 10x10 grid of streets and avenues, while Karel's the only one alive in it.

In spite of Karel's limited size and scope, interesting problems can be posed for the programmer, with possibilities for interesting bugs, said creator Richard Pattis, a Stanford computer science instructor in 1984 (today at UC Irvine).

I think it speaks volumes about computer science that interesting tasks and difficulties can be found in such a tiny subset of the field. Chess is much the same way — chess is very hard, but bad chess teachers think they can and should get schoolkids up and running with one 20-minute lesson on the first day of class.

In my chess classes, I try to get the new kids playing a game with eight white pawns and one black queen. If one of the pawns crosses to the eighth rank — the "queening squares" — or captures the queen, the pawns win. If the queen captures all the pawns, or blocks the sole surviving pawn, the queen wins.

Some kids don't progress past that simpler game, and that's quite OK with me — they're probably having more fun with nine units on the board than a bewildering 32, while the experienced kids can practice useful chess skills in a reduced setting (forks, skewers, cutoff moves, pawn chaining, opposite wing play — it's all there, and can experienced tournament veterans might glean from this the critical importance of endgame play).
