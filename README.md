## Karel the Robot

In 1981 — three years ahead of the Macintosh 128K, and eight years before the paper envisioning the World Wide Web — Stanford computer science professor [Richard Pattis](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/) thought to make things easier for first-year programming students with the educational language [Karel](https://compedu.stanford.edu/karel-reader/docs/python/en/chapter1.html).

By omitting variables and data structures (except for the data structure representing the robot world), Pattis said students were more gently introduced to data abstraction and control structure. "Using this approach, students can plunge into programming and problem solving while incurring a minimum of overhead. They quickly learn to write well-structured programs (with potentially interesting bugs) instructing (the robot) to perform complicated tasks", [Pattis said](https://www.betterworldbooks.com/product/detail/karel-the-robot-a-gentle-introduction-to-the-art-of-programming-9780471597254). Karel was based in [Pascal](https://www.betterworldbooks.com/product/detail/karel-the-robot-a-gentle-introduction-to-the-art-of-programming-9780471089285)] — along with BASIC, two of the preeminent educational languages at the time — and prepared students for the rest of a Pascal course.

Karel was adapted for object-oriented programming as [Karel++](https://csis.pace.edu/~bergin/karel.html) in 1997, and Karel has been implemented in [RealBASIC](https://code.google.com/archive/p/rbstuff/), [TurboPascal](https://www.betterworldbooks.com/product/detail/turbo-pascal-and-karel-the-robot-9780471551072), [Java](https://github.com/fredoverflow/karel), [C](https://github.com/OTHRegensburgMedieninformatik/KarelLearnsC), [C++](https://github.com/ILXL-guides/intro-to-karel), [Python](https://github.com/alts/karel), [Ruby](https://github.com/davetron5000/rkarel), and [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/karel/index.html).

## In the Age of Skynet

[Is Karel still relevant?](https://talk.appletalk.com.au/t/beginners-programming-aka-is-karel-the-robot-still-relevant/2199) Kids today have a zillion extraordinary ways to learn programming — Scratch, Blocksy, Roblox, Minecraft EE, online coding games — and Karel always had [issues](https://repository.brynmawr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1034&context=compsci_pubs).

I asked ChatGPT is Karel still has a place in the world, and ChatGPT thought so (but if you've talked to it yourself, maybe you've also seen that it only has good words to say about anything). If you search the web for Karel-related content, you find that Karel still has value for those who find value in Karel. Karel is a relic, but so am I. Karel still has much to teach me, like Crystal. I aim to learn Crystal by implementing Karel in Crystal.

## Crystal

I'm old. My first programming experience was in [HyperCard](https://hypercard.org), the software construction kit that Apple used to include with Macintoshes, and I learned some Pascal when I was young. The first language that I loved was Ruby, a scripting language that could've been used as widely as Python if the development community hadn't behaved as though Ruby's niche was web development, while Python was for everything else. 

Ruby is elegant and easily read. Crystal, with similar syntax, aims to combine the grace of Ruby with the speed of C. For me, love at first sight. For others, static type checking, null reference checks, a powerful macro system, green threads, C bindings, a helpful [community](https://crystal-lang.org/community/). So far, books from [Pragmatic Bookshelf](https://pragprog.com/titles/crystal/programming-crystal/) and [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/product/crystal-programming/9781801818674).
